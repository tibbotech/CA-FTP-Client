# FTP Client - V2

This demo transforms a Tibbo device into an FTP client. This effectively lets you publish data on an external webserver directly. It was originally developed by **Carlo Tauraso** to interface a DS202 with a WS2300 Professional Weather Station and submit the station's sensor data to an FTP server. The project has been updated to reflect changes in Taiko and add more comments.

*The project includes a JPEG image depicting how it works.*
